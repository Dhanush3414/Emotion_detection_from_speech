Emotion Detection from Speech 
This project implements an Emotion Detection System using speech input.  
It recognizes emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) from audio input using machine learning / deep learning models.

---

Features
- Speech input via microphone or audio file
- Preprocessing of audio signals (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.)
- Trained machine learning / deep learning model for emotion classification
- Real-time emotion prediction
